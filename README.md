# MenuBarTrigger
## macOS command line utility for displaying a menubar item with a popover web view, while simultaneously running a process
The popover is a locally hosted webview. You can give MenuBarTrigger more than one web view and command to present, in which case it will move on to the next pair once the previous command finishes executing.
If the web view content has form input elements, eg. a checkbox, placed within the <form></form> tags, MenuBarTrigger can send the input value to standard output. 
Each webview/command pair can have an icon allocated to it, so that the menubar icon changes as MenuBarTrigger progresses along the webview/command chain.

It is written in Swift 3 and has been tested and confirmed to work on macOs 10.12.6 up to 10.14.3

## Usage: 

>MenuBarTrigger.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarTrigger WEBVIEW_1 COMMAND_1 
>WEBVIEW_2 COMMAND_2 ... [OPTIONS]

MenuBarTrigger displays a webView pop-over while simultaneously executing a command. Once the command
finishes executing MenuBarTrigger moves on to the next webView/command pair.

### WEBVIEW
The local HTML file or HTML string to display
-f, --file <path to file>
OR
-html, --html <HTML string>

### COMMANDv1.0.pkg
The command to execute. Command can be a shell command or a jamf binary command.

**Example shell commands:**
'sleep 5'

'/tmp/a_script.sh'

"/usr/sbin/installer -package '/tmp/CocoaDialog v2.1.1.pkg' -target /"

Note the single quotes to wrap around the filename with spaces.

**Accepted jamf commands:**
All jamf verbs, although be warned that MenuBarTrigger has only been tested with jamf binary versions 9.61 - 9.97, so far.
Note: MenuBarTrigger assumes that the binary is in /usr/local/bin/jamf. Specify fullpath if you relocated the binary.
MenuBarTrigger needs to be run as root to run jamf commands.

**Example jamf commands:**
>"policy -trigger 'microsoft office'"

>"policy -trigger vlc"

>"recon"

**There is one special MenuBarTrigger commands: wait**

wait displays the webView until a particular link on the presented HTML.

MenuBarTrigger.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarTrigger WEBVIEW wait 

What occurs once the link is clicked depends on the url:
- A link to "next", eg. `<a href="http://next">NEXT</a>`, makes MenuBarTrigger proceed to the next web view/command pair.
- A link to "formParse", eg. `<a href="http://formParse">Submit</a>`, will inspect any form values and return the results to stdout. before proceeding to the next web view/command pair.
- A link to "quit", eg. `<a href="http://quit">Done</a>`, terminates MenuBarTrigger.
Be sure to add http:// in the link URL (required by macOS 10.12.4+)
